This project focuses on developing a robust Convolutional Neural Network model to predict various lung diseases using respiratory sound recordings from the ICBHI (International Conference on Biomedical and Health Informatics) dataset. The primary research question guiding this study is "How can Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) be effectively used to predict lung diseases using respiratory sound recordings? Respiratory disorders, such as Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD), Asthma, Pneumonia etc., significantly impact global health, making early and accurate diagnosis crucial. The ICBHI dataset provides large collection of annotated respiratory sound recordings, offering a valuable resource in developing machine learning and deep learning models. The project involves preprocessing of respiratory sound data, feature extraction, and the design and training of CNN models to detect and classify lung diseases. The modelâ€™s performance was evaluated using various metrics. The result demonstrated that CNNs could effectively predict and give high accuracy for several lung diseases. This research underscores the feasibility and effectiveness of CNNs for automated respiratory analysis, providing a promising tool for enhancing respiratory healthcare diagnostics. The findings of this project showcase the potential of CNN-based models in aiding early diagnosis and improving patient outcomes, contributing to the growing field of AI applications.
